    <h3>Erin Yeager</h3>
    <img src="Images/Erin Yeager.jpg" class="center"/>
    <p>Eren Yeager  is a former member of the Survey Corps. He is the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents and adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan. This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.
    <br/><br/>
    Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan serum.
    <br/><br/>
    In the year 847, Eren, Mikasa, and his best friend Armin Arlert joined the 104th Training Corps. The three graduated with Eren ranking 5th best, and they joined the Survey Corps following the battle of Trost District.
    <br/><br/>
    After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the ocean.</p>

    <h3>Armin Arlelt</h3>

    <p>Armin Arlelt  is a soldier in the Scout Regiment. He is also a childhood friend of Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackermann, and is one of the two deuteragonists of the series. Although he appears to be the physically weakest of the 104th Cadet Corps, his high intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset, though he does not consider himself to be one and is known to have low self-esteem. After the battle of Shiganshina District, he took the power of the Titans from Bertholdt Hoover and became the Colossal Titan.</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <h3>Mikasa Ackermann</h3>
    <img src="Images/Mikasa ackerman.jpg" class="center"/>
    <p>Mikasa Ackerman is one of the two deuteragonists of the series. She is the adoptive daughter of Grisha and Carla Jaeger and the adoptive sister of Eren Jaeger.
    <br/><br/>
    After her biological mother and father were murdered by bandits, Mikasa was rescued by Eren. She lived with him and his parents for approximately one year before the Fall of Wall Maria.
    <br/><br/> 
    Though she desires only to live a peaceful life with Eren, Mikasa chose to follow him into the militaryâ€”where she is considered the best soldier among the 104th Cadet Corps. She later joined the Scout Regiment to continue following and protecting Eren.</p>
